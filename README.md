[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/de8e3a5da7404dd19879df93f3b6de60)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/usulrasolas/PCEternitiesMap?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=usulrasolas/PCEternitiesMap&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

 A Planechase Eternities Map Program (Currently for Windows PC or other .NET compatible systems)

This is a program to emulate the Blind Eternities Map variant of planechase (https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/eternities-map-2010-07-19-0) for Magic the Gathering. This is a fan project, 100% free and open source and monitization free. Created to be simple to use, allow players to play in a more convenient way than using a secondary or oversized table, as well as making this format more accessible to a variety of players old and new.

We're dedicated to being an open-source program with no in-app purchases, ads, monitization and no internet connection required once downloaded. We only wanted to play this format on our tv without using a 2nd table and the extra time and hassle of tracking a large eternities map game. Commits/Pulls/Contributions are welcome as this is a labor of love put together with extra time and metal willpower!
