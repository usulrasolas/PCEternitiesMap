# PCEternitiesMap
 A Planechase Eternities Map Program

This is a Windows program to emulate the Blind Eternities Map variant of planechase (https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/eternities-map-2010-07-19-0)

This was created to be easy to use, allow players to use this in a more convenient way than using physical cards (the Map can get very big and take up a lot of room on the table), as well as making this more accessible to new players.

This is a FREE open-source program, no in-app purchases, no ads, no internet connection required.

So far features include:

* New game/refresh table
* 3 Distance diagonal grid to see all adjacent discovered planes
* choosing new planes
* Putting counters on planes (Aretopolis, Kilnspire District, etc.)
* Finite Persistant Map Mode
* card event handling
* chaos triggers that involve extra card display
* a bunch of options to customize gameplay

Features needed still:
* Phenomenon support
* more settings menu (as they come)

For gamemode settings, this is what we have planned out:

* percentage chance for helljump phenomenon (0% to disable)(Default: 50%)
* percentage chance for normal movement phenomenon (0% to disable)(Default: 0%)
* disable/enable normal planeschase. (after 1.0)
